My family and I visited Paris in 2015. We had booked an Airbnb, but were unable to find it (we were on foot, carrying all our luggage). I saw a lady washing her car on the street, so I showed her the address on my phone. She was unable to speak English but invited me into her house and gave me her WIFI password so I could log on to the network and use Google Maps. Then she called her son, who could speak fluent English, and handed me the phone so he could give me more accurate directions. Just horrible.

I was born in France, and raised in the US, but went back to France enough to sort of get a feel for the differing dynamics (including my college studies).

As a child, France was always a Utopia in my mind. I’d spend my Summers in Paris and in Anglet (South of France around the Basque Country). I’d eat amazing cheese for 2€ and under a piece. I’d walk to the bakery every morning with my sister and

How do I draw 3D sketches?
Interesting question.

I have done quite a few and you can see the videos of a collection of my work in 3D sketches.

Many with the Paintology Drawing App from the Google play store.

Video 1. This was my first 3D drawing - very easy to do!

Video 2. A 3D glass drawn on the phone - a recent drawing.

Vid 3. I improved on a drawing that I found on the internet, took me 10 mins to make with the line/shade brushes.

Vid 4. I decided to do this trick drawing and looks real!

Dear edgy troll,
I won’t answer your question : many people have already done it .
I only want to thank you for asking this shitty question and giving me the opportunity, when reading the answers, to see that so many people are in love with my wonderful country.
They also explained why and made me rediscover why I love my country instead of taking all for granted as the stupid French person I am. So many thanks to them too !

I have been living in Grenoble, France for the past 10 months. And the following experiences does indeed prove that France is a horrible place to stay.

I question the very premise of your question - indeed a preposterous and utterly ludicrous one at that.

I am a transplant from Norway living in France and have enjoyed every moment of my life here. Despite having arrived here with virtually no skills in French to speak of, I did not encounter the much ballyhooed prejudices against non French speakers that gets bandied about in Anglophone circles.

I have access to the most exquisite cuisine in the world and matching wines to go with. I enjoy the 2 hour lunch breaks. Indeed, I find that my productivity has increased thanks to my being able to have

France is not horrible, and neither are the people from my experience.

I had a flight that was delayed from Philadelphia, heading to Southampton UK with a layover at Charles De Gaulle Airport . I was suppose to have a 8 hour layover in France but since our flight to Philadelphia was delayed for almost the same amount of hours, I missed my connecting flight. I also had no luggage. The security lines were long and their were many shuttles. After I got to where I was supposed to be the plane was taxing. I assumed I would make it.

I was traveling alone with my baby son. I went to the help desk and m

I’m a US citizen who speaks no French. Recently, I went on a week’s touring in the Normandy region (beautiful and historic!). Before I left, many acquaintances warned me about “nasty, snobbish” French people.

One morning I wanted to mail postcards; on the street, I asked a lady for directions. This “nasty, snobbish” lady gave me directions (in perfect English) and went out of her way half a block to walk to a corner from which she could point out a landmark she mentioned.

Entering the post office, I took off my prescription glasses and put the non-tinted prescription pair (the “indoor” pair) on.

Q; Why is france so Horrible?

A: The People

There may be many a french people reading this that are downright insulted and annoyed with my answer. …Good!

I have travelled the world, I am Multi lingual. Yet it means nothing when visiting France particularly if you have the audacity to visit France and NOT speak French.

I give you one small Instance of French arrogance and why France or to be more blunt, its people, can make it a horrible place to visit if you meet the wrong ones.

I don’t really get why someone asked me to answer this… It’s soooo obvious guys !

France is horrible for so many reasons that there is not enough of a lifetime to explain them all. I therefore have to boil down to the 5 main reasons for me:

Landscapes in France. 1st reason. Awful. You have to pay me to ‘discover’ these landscapes; have you ever seen the Calanques of Cassis ? or the small villages nested in the heart of the Alps ? or the deep forest full of legends of Bretagne ? Never ever want to do this.
Food. I know, I know, it is an easy one. Food is nasty in France. Better eat a big fat hambu
