38 reasons we should hate the French (or at least dislike them mildly)

I have a theory that the Irish rugby team's appalling record in Paris is the result of us having too much admiration for France as a country. I've racked my brain for a list of reasons we should hate the French, or at least dislike them mildly.
1. Thierry Henry.
2. The Normans.
3. Irregular verbs.
4. You spend years learning their language, then you go to Paris to practice it and they talk back to you in English.
5. Nice food. Lovely wine. But they still can't make a decent cup of tea.
6. The 2012 frozen pitch.
7. The ugliness of Parisian hotel wallpaper as a contributing factor in the death of Wilde.
8. The French paradox. They eat lots of fatty foods but don't get heart disease. It's not fair.
9. The rudeness of Parisians.
10. They even have a street called Rue Rude and the Irish Embassy is on it.
11. In fact, the embassy is on the corner of Avenue Foch and Rue Rude. That's "Foch 'n' Rude", for short. (Okay, the "c" in Foch is soft, but first-time visitors aren't to know that.)
12. We always hum along with their anthem at sporting events. They still don't even know the tune of ours.
13. Foie gras. French women may not get fat, but goose livers don't have a choice.
14. We gave them Joyce and Beckett, who revolutionised modern literature. They gave us Dion Boucicault, who devised a new improved version of the stage Irishman.
15. Je t'aime (moi non plus) .
16. They're obsessed with sex, generally.
17. Even their bread is phallocentric.
18. "Va va voom". The sound of Thierry Henry handling the ball twice and then getting away with it.
19. Le Piat d'Or. The French didn't adore it at all. They wouldn't wash their cars with it, probably.
20. We gave them the honour of playing the first rugby game in Croke Park. Then they ruined the occasion by winning, and with a gut-wrenching last-minute try.
21. La trahison des (Vincent) Clercs .
22. The original Chauvinist – Nicolas Chauvin – was French.
23. The Marquis de Sade probably wasn't the original sadist, but he was so good at it they named it after him.
24. When the Bastille was stormed in 1789, a shocking 14 per cent – at least – of the prison population was Irish. His name was James Francis Xavier Whyte (there were only six or, by some accounts, seven inmates left at the time of the storming) and he was mentally disturbed, so he shouldn't have been in jail at all.
25. The same poor man had shared prison for a time with the Marquis de Sade. No wonder he was disturbed.
26. The Franco-Prussian War. Started by the French because they didn't like the wording of a telegram.
27. The Treaty of Versailles.
28. We supplied a French-speaking referee, Alain Rolland, for last month's France-Wales game. And how did they repay his respect for their language? By addressing him as "Tu", that's how!
29. We asked them for an army in 1798. They sent a mere 1,000 soldiers, none of them named "Napoleon".
30. Also, they landed here in August. The main rebellion had been in June. We know it's fashionable to arrive 15 minutes late for dinner parties in France, but it doesn't work so well with insurrections.
31. They didn't send any soldiers at all in 1803, despite repeated invitations.
32. Even when they did supply military help, results were mixed. In 1798, they fought well at Castlebar, but were mediocre in Ballinamuck. That's the problem with French armies – you never know which side is going to turn up on the day.
33. They "honoured" the bicentenary of 1798 by starting the Tour de France in Ireland. A succession of drug scandals later, it became known as the "Tour de Dopage".
34. Marshal Patrice de Mac-Mahon. All right, they made him president, but where did they get that hyphen?
35. L'Origine du Monde by Gustave Courbet (look it up). The model is believed to have been Irish. What would her poor Mammy have thought?
36. They have a province called "Brittany". No "Irelandy", though.
37. "I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her [Marie Antionette] with insult. But the age of chivalry is dead. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever." Edmund Burke, Reflections on the Revolution in France .
38. Did I mention Thierry Henry?

My family and I visited Paris in 2015. We had booked an Airbnb, but were unable to find it (we were on foot, carrying all our luggage). I saw a lady washing her car on the street, so I showed her the address on my phone. She was unable to speak English but invited me into her house and gave me her WIFI password so I could log on to the network and use Google Maps. Then she called her son, who could speak fluent English, and handed me the phone so he could give me more accurate directions. Just horrible.

I was born in France, and raised in the US, but went back to France enough to sort of get a feel for the differing dynamics (including my college studies).

As a child, France was always a Utopia in my mind. I’d spend my Summers in Paris and in Anglet (South of France around the Basque Country). I’d eat amazing cheese for 2€ and under a piece. I’d walk to the bakery every morning with my sister and

How do I draw 3D sketches?
Interesting question.

I have done quite a few and you can see the videos of a collection of my work in 3D sketches.

Many with the Paintology Drawing App from the Google play store.

Video 1. This was my first 3D drawing - very easy to do!

Video 2. A 3D glass drawn on the phone - a recent drawing.

Vid 3. I improved on a drawing that I found on the internet, took me 10 mins to make with the line/shade brushes.

Vid 4. I decided to do this trick drawing and looks real!

Dear edgy troll,
I won’t answer your question : many people have already done it .
I only want to thank you for asking this shitty question and giving me the opportunity, when reading the answers, to see that so many people are in love with my wonderful country.
They also explained why and made me rediscover why I love my country instead of taking all for granted as the stupid French person I am. So many thanks to them too !

I question the very premise of your question - indeed a preposterous and utterly ludicrous one at that.

I am a transplant from Norway living in France and have enjoyed every moment of my life here. Despite having arrived here with virtually no skills in French to speak of, I did not encounter the much ballyhooed prejudices against non French speakers that gets bandied about in Anglophone circles.

I have access to the most exquisite cuisine in the world and matching wines to go with. I enjoy the 2 hour lunch breaks. Indeed, I find that my productivity has increased thanks to my being able to have

France is not horrible, and neither are the people from my experience.

I had a flight that was delayed from Philadelphia, heading to Southampton UK with a layover at Charles De Gaulle Airport . I was suppose to have a 8 hour layover in France but since our flight to Philadelphia was delayed for almost the same amount of hours, I missed my connecting flight. I also had no luggage. The security lines were long and their were many shuttles. After I got to where I was supposed to be the plane was taxing. I assumed I would make it.

I was traveling alone with my baby son. I went to the help desk and m

I’m a US citizen who speaks no French. Recently, I went on a week’s touring in the Normandy region (beautiful and historic!). Before I left, many acquaintances warned me about “nasty, snobbish” French people.

One morning I wanted to mail postcards; on the street, I asked a lady for directions. This “nasty, snobbish” lady gave me directions (in perfect English) and went out of her way half a block to walk to a corner from which she could point out a landmark she mentioned.

Entering the post office, I took off my prescription glasses and put the non-tinted prescription pair (the “indoor” pair) on.

Q; Why is france so Horrible?

A: The People

There may be many a french people reading this that are downright insulted and annoyed with my answer. …Good!

I have travelled the world, I am Multi lingual. Yet it means nothing when visiting France particularly if you have the audacity to visit France and NOT speak French.

I give you one small Instance of French arrogance and why France or to be more blunt, its people, can make it a horrible place to visit if you meet the wrong ones.

I don’t really get why someone asked me to answer this… It’s soooo obvious guys !

France is horrible for so many reasons that there is not enough of a lifetime to explain them all. I therefore have to boil down to the 5 main reasons for me:

Landscapes in France. 1st reason. Awful. You have to pay me to ‘discover’ these landscapes; have you ever seen the Calanques of Cassis ? or the small villages nested in the heart of the Alps ? or the deep forest full of legends of Bretagne ? Never ever want to do this.
Food. I know, I know, it is an easy one. Food is nasty in France. Better eat a big fat hambu
